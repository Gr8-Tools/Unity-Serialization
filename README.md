# Unity Binary Serialization

This Package contains tools that help serialize and dserialize data of different type to/from byte-array (`byte[]`) or `ArraySegment` with zero memory allocation.

This realisation is based on unsafe methods like read/write values with array-pointers on memory.

Developed on a version of unity #2020.3. You can add `https://github.com/Gr8-Tools/Unity-Serialization.git?path=Packages/Binary-Serialization` to Package Manager
